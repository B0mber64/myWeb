		<h1>All About Landen Nickloy</h1>
			<p>Landen Nickloy was born in Brian, Ohio on May 10th, 2005. His parents are Mindy Edelman and Russel Nickloy.</p><p> He enjoys playing games, talking with people, listening to music, and watching things such as Twitch, Youtube, Netflix, and anime. </p>
		<h2>Gaming</h2>
			<p>Landen has played games ever since he was in kindergarten. One of the first and most memorable games He's ever played was The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. 
			Obviously being his first game he wasn't too great at it, but played it with his Dad, they would take turns. 
			He would usually read the text that came up, although his dad wasn't great at reading Landen still loved the gameplay and the story.</p>
			<p>The Legend of Zelda is still one of his all-time favorite franchises, but Wind Waker most out of all of them. Through the years he would play the Wii, PlayStation2, GameCube, Xbox360, and some other consoles if he were at someone's house who had something different. 
			When he got a gaming computer, he could do a lot more than before with an all in one desktop. He had gotten a Nintendo Switch about a year ago as well, he has spent a lot of time on that, typically playing Mario or Zelda for the most part. 
			Playing games is something he does daily, weither it's something small on his phone and just a little bit on the computer or switch, to playing a game for hours on end, usually with a friend.</p>
			<p>Some of the top favorite games of his are Team Fortress 2, Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas, Subnautica, just about all of the 3D mario platformers, most of the 3D Legend of Zelda games, and Minecraft.
			Landen's all-time favorite game is most likely The Binding of Isaac. With the ratio of the amount of time playing the game, to the amount of time having the game, the time he has spent on The Binding of Isaac is undoubtably the largest. 
			In less than 2 years he amounted over 500 hours of play time. Landen is no where close to being the greatest at the game though, many struggles still plague him though his </p>
